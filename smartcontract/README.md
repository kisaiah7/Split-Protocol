# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```
### Using ABI and contract addresses

Abi and contract address can be found in /abis folder as `<ContractName>.json` where `<ContractName>` is the name of the contract.
